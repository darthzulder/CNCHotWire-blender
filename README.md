## Usage

1. Import and position the 3D object to be cut in Blender.
2. Adjust the script parameters to match your CNC machine and cutting requirements.
3. Run the script in Blender.
4. The CNC hotwire machine will align with the 3D object, and the original block will be positioned accordingly.
5. A surrounding structure will be created to support the cutting process.
